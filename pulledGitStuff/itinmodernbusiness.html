             Chances are good that you’re already using some type of analytic tools to monitor your traffic and sales numbers (if not, you really need to modernize a.s.a.p.) but did you know that your analytics can be doing more for you? Analytic software has improved significantly in the past few years and it can do more than just tell you how many people are visiting your homepage; it can also give you valuable insights into things like customer behavioral patterns and marketing performance. For example, Google Analytics can help identify holes in your sales funnel by telling you which pages are converting and which are underperforming, which types of users are visiting your site, what page they land on, where they go next, and how long they stay. With this data, you can create marketing strategies to target users more effectively and ultimately improve your sales funnel. But if you don’t take the time to use all of the features provided by your analytics software, you will end up missing out on potentially vital information that can help your business grow.

         <p>   There are several risks that digital projects face, and here I will list a few. For instance, insufficient tools and training represent an obvious risk. In addition, when working with complex and often detail-heavy programming, it is essential that each team-member remains motivated and can work collaboratively with the appropriate tools. When planning a project, it is a risk not to have the customer in mind, whether in terms of accessibility, or even UX. A project needs to be maintained with clear goals, otherwise team-members can run the risk of going off task and decreasing efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial to have a consistent methodology throughout the planning of projects.</p>

                <br><b>Summary of Solutions</b> to these common issues are a combination of people, processes and tools. There is no 'magic button.' Good processes should be implemented that are customized for the business. If outside consultants need to be hired to help define these processes, then they should be brought on board. Software solutions that support these processes need to be utilized or invested in. Once invested in, the solutions need to be supported by top management.  Executive management must show leadership by spending the time it takes to plan, set goals and strategies, prior to embarking on projects. Project managers must be bold enough to contribute and give feedback when executives' expectations are unrealistic. Team members must get on board once projects have begun and task assignments have been communicated.*PMI is a registered trademark of Project Management Institute, Inc.. "

               In building a website, the appropriate IT systeming and software must be used. When deciding, there are some key criteria to bear in mind. For example, choosing a system may depend on whether performance and functionality must be prioritised (an executive support system), readability (a management information system), or even automation (a transaction processing system may be best in this case). Additionally, it is important to consider the skills and support in maintaining the system chosen, along with its security

               Most businesses have several information systems in place. For example:

               executive support systems - typically involve data analysis and planning tools to help with strategic decision-making
               management information systems - usually work with internal sources of information and help organise, evaluate, manage and present data in a readable form
               decision support systems - typically rely on databases to produce 'what-if' type of analysis
               knowledge management systems - help businesses create, share and manage information, often collaboratively
               transaction processing systems - automate routine transactions, such as billing, payroll, stock control, etc
               office automation systems - enable processing of data and information in a productive, efficient way
               With all these systems, there are options to suit every kind of business.

                <p> The chosen technologies that have helped me execute my site include Trello, Visual Studio Code and GitHub. Trello has helped me plan and organise the building of my site using the Kanban technique. This has allowed me to assign tasks into one of three columns ‘to do,’ ‘doing,’ and ‘done,’ which has enabled me to keep on top of my progress. Visual Studio Code has helped me write my code, and has been a place where I could format my content with HTML and CSS, previewing it as I go. Finally, GitHub has allowed me to work on various devices, as I ‘push’ any changes to my online repository so that they can be ‘pulled’ onto a second laptop. GitHub has also allowed me to publish my site, creating shareable links by which I can view it.

               Git is a free and open source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.
       
               Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has lead to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allow teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each others code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development..
