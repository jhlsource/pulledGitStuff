            <p> Hey there I am Jun-Hon Lau,

                intention throughout my life, has been towards how I can connect people 
                to live their most joyful manifestation of their own, and I intend to 
                do this through the use and application of digital technologies.
        <br><br>I have been interested in Digital Technologies, and their uses for a long
                time, my passions lie in the junction where craft and technique intercepts
                expression. With a unique creative mind, I dedicate my life to the service of
                humanity reaching its highest form of self-expression.
        <br><br>Current skill set:
            <br> - Excellent Communication verbally and written,
            <br> - Programming,
            <br> - Pattern draughting and garment manufacturing,
            <br> - Understanding of design process from initial ideas to specification,
            <br> - Ballet,
            <br> - Colour Aptitude.
       
        <br><br>Witin this website I am going to pass on my knowledge aling with the sources that
                I used to learn from, by applying my creative mind to problem solving.
        <br><br>As I endeavour to advance my skills as a programmer, an opportunity presented to 
                me through the enterprise: Code Nation, to whom I will be eternally grateful.
        <br><br>As I take my first steps in digital engineering with this website. It will feature
                content I find inspiring, I invite you, dear reader, to follow me on my journey
                for positive and unique outcome-based solutions.
