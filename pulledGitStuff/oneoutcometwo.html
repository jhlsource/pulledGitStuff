    <p> Sometimes I did wonder whether Trello did enhance building my website. I think it definitely helped with productivity however not with efficiency, although as mentioned before, I have a lot yet to learn about the app to get the best use and best practice out of it.    
        <br>
        <br>  Git definitely saved my life in terms of being able to work remotely on any machine. Because it is cloud-based, I was able to create when not in the office in order to fulfil on criteria. Git has really increased my productivity and efficiency levels. 
        <br> 
        <br>  VS Code was harder to access. I found writing content was best done on another app, like Google Docs, because of spell and grammar checking capabilities. Editing code on VSCode was good because of the built in capabilities. However visually, it’s easier to edit on Google Docs, because it was visually easier to edit code when there was a ‘virtual’ margin on the screen. Again, I’m sure this is more to do with having a lot more to learn about the software and picking up coding language at my stage, and, understanding best practices in code layout.

    <h2>3.2<h4>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency. </h4> </h2>
        <p>a) I found it a challenge to focus personally because of my attention deficit disorder. So how I managed my desktop was crucial to my productivity. Having a messy desktop throughout the project really took my attention away from working whenever I was jumping between different apps. Sometimes I would not prioritise organising my computer’s desktop workspace and it would impact on my productivity both during the project, and, subsequently when tidying up the build up of disorganisation. 
            <br><br>b) Although I know this will improve over time, I find my lack of knowledge in coding language  and not understanding each component of a line of coding made the whole research process inefficient, especially when I came across the same solutions phrased in different ways. It made adapting my research slower as I was putting more energy into worrying about time constraints. 
            <br><br>c) Looking up codes that I have already used and want to use again was not done very efficiently because I kept these at the top of my website’s index.html.
            <br><br>d) Staying focused was a huge pitfall in terms of time management. I find I would often burn out and get confused or be absorbed in a particular problem or overthink what was required of a task.
            <br><br>e) Not having drawn up a visual plan - quickly hand-drawn, meant I was not able to analyse and critique my ideas in setting out what I wanted my website to look like. I improvised the styling of my website and working blind, not having a clear plan and goal to execute. In my past experience, whenever research is mixed with execution, the process often becomes very tiring and inefficient because gathering research and following through on tasks uses differing parts of the brain/mindset, and switching between the two modes uses a lot of energy. As a caveat, following through on tasks can be classed as research since discoveries can be made during the implementing of technique, I do not include these instances when I consider this. 
            <br><br>f) Dyslexia/Irlen Syndrome was a challenge when coding and researching because text appears to vibrate on the screen so quickly it becomes a blur - akin to the speed of lightning. To counteract this I used Firefox’s background colour change setting in ‘Preferences’. The draw back of this, though, was that it became apparent that this worked by overriding a website’s styling script from a certain point at the beginning of a script somewhere. So as a result, a lot of styling of a website disappeared, like borders, filled boxes and frames, making the website hard to interact with.

    <h2>3.3<h4>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h4></h2>
        <p>a) Closing down windows when they are not in use would clear a lot of mental space. Originally, windows were kept open to avoid the frustration of taking a lot of time to open up files as needed when doing a task. However, if having a chaotic desktop is impacting on productivity to the extent that it has been, the payoff of retrieving files in this way is dwarfed by the cost to my productivity. To tackle this issue, I propose that I would have to update my filing system. If I am unsure, then taking time to research how and asking peers how they stay on top of this would benefit my productivity. 
                <br><br>One of the first things in the develop coding course that I learned was to name files by omitting the use of spaces and having all the letters lowercase. Extending this simple technique to my existing files meant I was able to focus on naming the file and not how to name it which sped up the act of organising/rearranging. Having a clear system of file management without having excess files left open will release a lot of mental space as it means being able to focus solely on one project at a time. In theory, this will hopefully fine-tune focus and increase productivity. Another benefit of closing down files is that my computer’s RAM will be freed up - speeding up the computer. Closing down files ensures tasks are completed more often because I won’t depend on a file being open on my desktop to remind me to come back to complete it, which isn’t a very effective system anyway, and I will have to depend on a different method, like OmniFocus, for example. 
        <br><br>b) Solution to not understanding coding enough to get the most out of my research, could be that I listen to podcasts about coding so that I’m absorbing the fluency in talking about and processing information about coding. 
        <br><br>c) Handwriting solutions to coding in a notebook that I can retrieve code from manually OR creating my own code library that I can quickly lookup solutions to, then copy n paste would be ideal, if I have forgotten how to write something and want to remind myself.
        <br><br>d) As for time management, I find I would in the future use an egg timer to adopt the Pomodoro Technique - 25/10 rule. Like having my own personal standup for 10mins after every 25 minutes of productivity.
        <br><br>e) Drawing up a clear picture from my head of a design/styling layout before going in with finding out how to, and creating the website at the same time would streamline energy and attention to focus on the outcome. 
        <br><br>f) Establish which colour facilitates my Irlen Syndrome and wear coloured glasses instead of changing screen or background colour.

    <h2>3.4<h4>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h4></h2>        
        <p>
            To test digital solutions, I would probably view my website across different platforms. For example, tablets, consoles and mobile devices. Even though the website works across different browsers, I found that I probably need to use an If/Else function to redirect the viewer depending on the device they were using to view the website. What I found, when seeing the website on an iPhone 6, was my CSS was perhaps too generalistic and the parameters for borders and padding, for example, did not work well on a smaller device. 
            <br><br>It would be a good idea to ask QA friends of mine to take a look, and, a piece of advice that I got from Accenty Founder, was to keep asking people their opinions of your product and keep making changes to it based on their feedback, even if it means you don’t agree, or feel attacked, or that it’s impossible, try to achieve the change anyway and see where the journey leads you. If I combined JavaScript with Flex, I predict that I would get the desired result for my website to facilitate on different platforms. Although for this, research needs to be done first. 
            <br><br>Finally, just asking people I know about what they think of my website with a real interest in what someone’s opinion is, will really get the ball rolling. I predict at first, some feedback will be the obvious ones that I can spot. However after a while, I predict the conversation will get more interesting.
