  <div class="color-box">  <h2>2.1<h4> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change the required approach when making your site.</h4></h2> 
<p>    Trello was used to break up the tasks. I personally would find it more useful to use Trello as a way to capture tasks and ideas. What I could do for the future is to learn how to use Trello to help me think logically about a task at hand.
    <br>
    <br>  VSCode was used to code the website and help me spot mistakes. I like how the platform immediately shows up any language that cannot be processed as well as predictive coding. 
    <br> 
    <br>  Github was used to enable me to relocated to different workstations and access the Git from anywhere. In future I would probably break down each commit to the type of code I was editing. Then, looking back through all the commits I would be able to ‘un-change’ specific edits, for example, if I wanted to achieve a certain effect with CSS rather than HTML, by labelling specific changes and compartmentalising changes if I wanted to unsplice.
  </p></div>


<div class="color-box">  <h2>2.2<h4>  Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h4></h2> 
<p>Trello was a really good tool for breaking down the research tasks, I think, and generally for visualising and tracking the progress of anything requiring more than one task to complete, like any project. As mentioned before though, I feel like I can really do with taking some time to be patient and learning about using Trello as it was intended to be used, by the makers of the webapp, even though I have utilised it in my own way.
    <br>
    <br>VSCode was absolutely brilliant at organising folders and files, it was versatile to use, allowing me to jump back and forth between different files in a project to create continuity as required. I would definitely use it again. 
    <br>
    <br>GitHub is a simple to use platform which does exactly what it says on the tin. Providing version control and backing up files as I went along. I can see the potential to help me learn and develop my skills to a much higher standard.
</p></div>
    

  <div class="color-box">  <h2>2.3<h4> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h4></h2> 
<p>    I think the outcome of my final project is very below par. I wanted something informative visually stunning, inspiring and intuitive to use. However, in doing this project I appreciate the challenge ahead of me; the patience and task at hand required to improve myself as a technical consultant. The strength is that is does match the criteria of the unit and passes the requirements and so fit for purpose. And in this journey, I have a new found curiosity and realm to play with, and as a vehicle to develop a newfound area for improvement! 
</p>  </div>


<div class="color-box">  <h2>2.4<h4> Describe further improvements you can make to your project. </h4></h2>
<p>    At the stage the website is as it is now, I would have studied more to enhance the coding to improve the presentation. For example I would make the text boxes more attractive and probably have the background in a fixed position. The colour scheme would be different. Edit the text to be concise. Turn the website into a blog so that the newest memo shows up first. I would also make a mobile friendly version so will have to figure out how my website can detect what platform the content is being viewed from, then respond to that by adapting. JavaScript is an area that I have not touched on and would enable to make the website more interactive. For example I first envisaged brightly coloured Flexboxes as a landing page. Now I am thinking I can have various topics floating around on the screen that the reader can choose as a choice or topic of interest that day. If my website is to be of service, I could add a search bar to search for topics so that it can be used to inform and also provide experimenting capabilities. Flexbox HTML Javascript and CSS has definitely not been utilised to the full extent.  
</p></div>


  <div class="color-box">    <h2>2.5<h4> Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose. </h4></h2>
<p>    In my personal view, I have created a .HTML file that displays content. The structure and best practice of the my html code can be refined further. Though I have refined it to the best of my ability within the timeframe, considering my cognitive constraints. Saying this, the website itself launches successfully and I am proud to understand how building a website works on a fundamental level, in terms of creating and maintaining it. 
    <br>
    <br>I have tried to use "divide"s to enhance the appearance of the website however due to time constraints I have not utilised these effectively in conjunction with creating style IDs. I originally used divides to section-off and contrast pleasantly with the background, however I have had to cancel the effect because it was too unattractive and the colours didn’t work together! As such, the divides that I have coded in have become obsolete as it was quicker to take away the background image than to pick another colour with the right opacity to set off the text in an effective manner to show the vibrancy and the potential of colour to inspire in a refined way. All this is not showing off the potential that divides, classes, ids can be used. So in terms of fulfilling the criteria of selling myself as a technical consultant, I have missed the mark as I have not utilised the basics of website design on this occasion.
